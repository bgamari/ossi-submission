# Hardware and software for single-molecule fluorescence analysis

The static conformations and structural dynamics of biological
macromolecules are of great interest to biological researchers.
Fluorescence spectroscopy techniques such as fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy and FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer provide access to
intramolecular distances, molecular sizes, conformational dynamics,
and reaction kinetics on single-molecule scales over a wide range of
timescales.

The lack of a common high-quality data acquisition and analysis
toolkit for fluorescence techniques has hindered reproducibility and
substantially raised the barrier to realizing a fluorescence
spectroscopic experiment. This is especially in the analysis of
fluorescence results, which can required sophisticated statistical
inference to account for a variety of experimental artifacts and
corrections.

We introduce an end-to-end open-source toolkit for fluorescence
spectroscopy experiments including inexpensive yet flexible data
acquisition hardware, software for processing resulting experimental
data, and a variety of tools for sophisticated statistical analysis of
results from a variety of common fluorescence experiments.
